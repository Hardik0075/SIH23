        <p>The recent decade has witnessed a significant boom in Technology.
        Technology has become more user-friendly and accessible over the years.
        This improvement in accessibility has led to dramatic growth in the
        number of users. Moreover, the user-friendly design of this project improves
        accessibility for users. As the number of users within a system grows,
        their queries and issues will also inadvertently increase. Tackling each
        and every query personally could prove to be expensive, time-consuming
        and inefficient. This Chatbot Assistant aims to streamline the process
        of providing technical help by automating the process. Instead of
        waiting for their issues to be resolved by a representative, users can
        directly approach the chatbot for help and get the answers to their
        questions. Moreover, the easy-to-use nature of this system improves
        accessibility for the customers.</p>

        <p>We are living in the age of decentralization and the removal of
        middlemen. The digital era is slowly transforming and replacing
        traditional methods. The benefit of this new technology is that it aims
        toward the decentralization and removal of third parties. It enables
        payments to be sent directly between parties without the need for a
        financial institution, such as a bank, to act as a middleman. Our
        Real-Estate booking System using Smart Contract blockchain technology
        could be applied to real estate transactions and minimize the need for
        third-party involvement. Blockchain technology could contribute to more
        efficient and transparent systems compared to traditional centralized
        solutions. Our project allows users to book a property and make secure
        payments with the help of Smart Contracts. In cirrus’s core wallet, the
        admin creates an account for each user and updates the wallet
        information in their profile and the transaction is done using the
        Cirrus API.</p>

        Once approved, the customer should receive the funds. However, in
        traditional systems, this process is often chaotic for valid reasons. As
        the customer base increases, servicing loans becomes complex.Our Loan

        system, the admin can log in/log out from the system. They have the
        authority to view, approve, block and delete the customers and manage
        their requests for a loan. The loan amount can also be transferred to the

        <p>A cloud file system is a storage system that allows for shared access to
        file data. Users have the ability to create, delete, modify, read, and
        write files. Cloud file sharing is a service that allows multiple users
        to access a common set of file data.Users can easily share files with
        one another by using our blockchain-based application and the
        cloud-based file sharing method. As a result, this system enables users
        to easily and effectively store and share files via cloud networks. When
        we upload data to the cloud, we typically lose control of it,
        introducing new security risks to the integrity and confidentiality of
        our data. For sensitive and private data, security is a major concern.
        The user can specify who has access to which resources based on certain

        implemented by using facial characteristics as biometrics. Attendance
        tracking is the most difficult task in any organization. Face
        recognition is a biometric technique that determines whether the image

        The primary goal of this project is to build a face recognition-based
        attendance monitoring system for employees working in an organization in
        order to improve and upgrade the current attendance system to make it
        more efficient and effective than before. The employee should be in an
        area containing light so that the detection can be clearly made. The
        facial recognition feature embedded in the attendance monitoring system
        not only ensures accurate attendance but also eliminates flaws.</p>

        predict the state of the atmosphere for a given location. Ancient
        weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of

        observed that if the sunset was particularly red, the following day
        often brought fair weather. However, since weather is unpredictable most
        of the times not all of these predictions prove reliable. This Weather
